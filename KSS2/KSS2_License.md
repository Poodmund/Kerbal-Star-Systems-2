Kerbal Star Systems 2 © 2025 by StarCrusher96 is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.  This means you **are NOT** free to share Kerbal Star Systems 2 (KSS2) in the way you might typically understand "sharing."  The NoDerivatives (ND) clause is crucial here.

**You cannot distribute or share the KSS2 mod files themselves.**

*   Give proper credit: While attribution is still important when discussing or showcasing KSS2, it doesn't grant you the right to distribute it.
*   Don't use it commercially: You cannot use KSS2 for any commercial purposes.
*   Don't modify it: You cannot alter, transform, or build upon KSS2 to create derivative works.

Important Note Regarding Textures, Models, Meshes, and Assets: While KSS2 itself is under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license, all textures, models, and meshes, unless explicitly stated otherwise, are under an All Rights Reserved license.  This means you cannot use, modify, or distribute these assets separately.  Many assets, such as terrain textures, models, and meshes, were purchased and are subject to their respective licenses.  Proof of purchase can be provided upon request.  Adaptations of Parallax by GamesLinx, including added textures, are *not* under All Rights Reserved.

The following asset types specifically fall under All Rights Reserved:

*   Planet textures (located in PluginData, including color, height, normal, and biomemaps)
*   Cloud maps (located in EVE folders, details included). These are a mixture of self-made and purchased assets (receipts available per formal request).
*   Terrain textures. These are a mixture of self-made and purchased assets (receipts available per formal request).
*   Models and Meshes (This includes most 3D assets within the mod).

For any licensing questions, especially concerning the textures, models, meshes, and other assets, please contact StarCrusher96 directly.  If it is unclear whether specific assets fall under All Rights Reserved, contacting StarCrusher96 is highly recommended.

This is a summary and not a replacement for reading the full license.  The full license text is the legally binding document.

*   Attribution (BY): You must credit StarCrusher96 when you discuss or showcase KSS2.

Section 2 – Scope.

a. License grant.
    1.Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
        B. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.

The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
    5. Downstream recipients.

    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i) .
b. Other rights.

    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
